I'll do my best to provide you with the information I have on record. Please note that I'll be sharing sensitive information, so I want to ensure you're aware of it.

From what I have, here's what I know about you:

**Personal Details:**

* Name: Unfortunately, I don't have your name on record.
* Age: You're 12 years old.
* Gender: You're male.
* Date of Birth (DOB): November 11, 2004.
* Occupation: You're a student.

**Lifestyle and Communication:**

* Languages: You speak Hindi, English, Urdu, and Punjabi.
* Lifestyle: You mentioned living a normal life, but I also have a note that seems to be inconsistent with your age - it says you live a life of a normal BTech student in India. BTech programs are typically for students who have completed their higher secondary education, which might not be the case for a 12-year-old.

**Family and Menstrual Info:**

* Family History: I don't have any information on your family medical history.
* Menstrual Info: This is not applicable for you, as you're male.

Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like to share or if you have any specific questions about your health or any other concerns!
